	The technological development and the advance without brakes of the technology at level
	worldwide has had a positive impact on virtually all
	areas of humanity, such as health, industrial production,
	telecommunications, transport, commerce, the military industry and
	armament√≠stica, the education, the daily activities of the home ...
	in short any area.
	Nowadays, activities that previously required a lot of effort on the part of
	the person can be performed very easily with a machine or
	artifact, which brings a consequent saving of time, money and more
	efficiency in the development of processes.
	
	Technological development is the systematic use of knowledge and
	research directed towards the production of materials, devices,
	systems or methods including the design, development, improvement of
	prototypes, processes, products, services or organizational models

	In a few words to a continuous process of training
	of the population for the incorporation, appropriation and application
		of scientific knowledge and what generated from these.
	Technological development implies the generation of skills and
	individual and collective creative capacities.</font></td>

 	60 years ago it was a country at war, split, with much
	poverty and enormous needs. However, South Korea
	managed to emerge from a complicated historical situation for
	position today as one of the strongest economies,
	innovative and with future perspectives. Far from being a
	miracle, South Korean development is based on familiar formulas:
	<br>
        education, technological development and competitiveness. The process of
	industrialization relied on highly skilled labor
	trained, who had the necessary competitiveness to win
	international markets and grow the economy towards
	outside.
	| <br>
	With a public policy oriented towards training
	of its people, the results began to be reaped in the
	1960s, when the country achieved growth
	aggressive economic situation that would be sustained over time, so that
	today South Korea is an exporting power, with a level
	income of the highest in the world and with rates of
	human development very high. Much of the achievements
	that today presumes this Asian country is based on the development
	technology and the enormous capacity for innovation that
	incubated in a solid educational training.

	With a small territory - it's four times smaller than
	Paraguay-, and with an investment in education relatively
	low (4.6% of GDP), has achieved much higher benefits than
	countries that allocate more resources to education: Korea
	South ranks third in number of registered patents
	globally, it is a leader in innovation and is the great provider
	world of televisions, plasma screens, audio equipment
	and appliances in general. All this speaks to us of a
	careful planning of the destination of the investments, of the
	austerity, efficiency and sacrifice that is applied to each
	entrepreneurship
	<br>
	When we look at the results of the studies
	international organizations, it is surprising that the
	South Koreans excel sharply in education
	technology, above great powers such as States
	United, Japan or China. They were the first worldwide
	in providing fast broadband Internet connections
	<br>
	to all elementary and secondary schools, while
	developed classrooms for interactive classes, where
	take advantage of all technology to produce knowledge.
	And with that innovative vision that characterizes them, they have
	implemented the "digital textbooks", through the
	which students can read, write and work on	
	a tablet (laptop with touch screen). The plan
	of the South Koreans in this sense is very ambitious:
	will invest 2 billion dollars for the development of books
	digital, as well as for the purchase of equipment
	necessary computer so that all students can read
	and interact from a tablet. With this they do not just pretend
	leave behind the use of paper, but seek to engage
	his students with technological education, with the
	development of innovative potential and, above all, they seek
	everyone has access to a universal database, where
	find the knowledge that is required to achieve
	competitiveness, progress and growth.

	Currently, Mexico ranks 63rd in terms of the adaptation of
	technology according to the World Economic Forum. This represents an advance of 13
	places with respect to the year 2012. Mexico has been one of the few countries that
	presented an advance in this area, but in turn, it continues to lag behind in others
	indicators such as the price for access to the mobile network (in which our country
	it is located at number 102) and in IT infrastructure development.
	All these numbers give us an idea of ??where our country is going in
	technology issues.

	<br>
        The great problem of our country in terms of the backlog for prices in telephony
	mobile and access prices to technology, are largely by monopoly
	that exists and which increases the prices of access to the Internet in a way
	important and that compared to other countries we are not close to having high
	access speeds.
	<br>
	In our times, more people have had access to technology, to new
	devices, smartphones, computers and tablets, but the penetration to
	Internet is still low within our country, being the price for access to
	the network of networks the biggest problem. This has brought with it a minimal advance in
	As for the economy.

	According to INEGI data, 40% of the Mexican population uses the
	Internet, which in comparison with other countries like the United States is a
	very low percentage. This brings with it the lag of the country in question technology,
	since through the network of networks we can access very information
	important, to publicize our business, products or services and be in
	constant communication with other people. Not accessing the Internet is a sign of
	lack of globalization in Mexico.
	  <br>
	The Mexican government is making clear efforts to bring the Internet to
	more people, currently in the Federal District, there are more than
	900 places of free Internet access, so that the people who visit those
	places can be in constant communication and pending their business.
	On the other hand, the American company Google has supported & quot; startups & quot; mexican
	develop proprietary technologies in Mexico.
	  <br>
	In conclusion, it will be imperative that our Government continue to enable greater
	number of free access "hot-spots" to generate greater growth in
	regarding technology in our country, as well as seeking to stop the monopoly and
	force them to lower prices and in this way ensure that more
	people have access to the Internet from their homes.
